# PNEUMONIA-DETECTION-WITH-CNN
This project aims at creating a CNN image classifier which classifies pneumonia affected and unaffected patients.

Hey guys this is me Dhamodaran,I request everyone to go through the  readme file thoroughly.

This model has been coded in google colab.

The dataset I used for training the model has 5000+ images and 600+ testing images and 16 validation images

The size of the dataset is 2.29GB.

so,if You use google colab it will be easy for you to build this model.

Image's width and height are above 1300 

so inorder to reduce the model training time i had downscaled images to 128*128.

I have also included the saved model file 'dhamo_pneumonia.h5'

So you can simple load the saved model and make the predictions.

Training a CNN for this will take you a long time so its advised to use the pretrained model.

Use summary method to know about my model's architecture

 Thank you,happy learning❤️..
 
 Jai Hind🇮🇳..
